The diagram consists of several boxes and arrows that indicate the direction of data flow between different stages. The first box is labeled “CompanyX Product Source”, indicating the source of the data extraction. Data flows into the “Slowly Changing Dimension” box where transformations occur. There are two outputs from this transformation: one flows into “Historical Attribute Inserts Output” and another to “Derived Column”. The “Derived Column” connects to an “OLE DB Command”, which then connects to “Union All”. Another output labeled as “New Output” emerges from the Slowly Changing Dimension and directly connects to “Insert Destination”. There is also a connection from “Union All” to “Derived Column 1”, which in turn connects to “Insert Destination”.
# Dim SalesTerritory 
![](image/Dim_SalesTerritory_ETL.PNG.png)
The process begins with extracting data from two sources: “OLE SalesTerritory Source” and “OLE DB Source.” These sources are then sorted individually before being merged and joined. The merged data flows into a slowly changing dimension task and an OLE DB command task simultaneously. The slowly changing dimension task outputs historical attribute inserts and new outputs that are transformed through derived columns before being united by a “Union All” operation. Finally, the transformed data is loaded into the “Insert Destination.”

## Conclution 

Our ETL pipeline endeavors go beyond conventional data handling. They embody a strategic vision, incorporating incremental loading and aspirations for (near) real-time updates. These processes not only enhance the efficiency of our data warehouse but position it as a responsive ecosystem, adaptive to the evolving landscape of Business Intelligence.

## RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation:
In the realm of Business Intelligence, understanding and categorizing customers play a pivotal role in driving strategic decision-making. The RFM model provides a powerful framework for this purpose, examining three crucial dimensions: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.

**Recency (R):**

Recency reflects the time elapsed since a customer's last interaction with the business. By assigning recency scores based on a reference date, we can categorize customers into segments such as Best, Loyal, and Regular. The recency scores are derived by analyzing the time intervals between customer interactions.

**Frequency (F):**

Frequency assesses how often a customer engages with the business, often measured by the number of units or products purchased in a transaction. Segments like Big Spenders, Regulars, and Almost Lost are identified by categorizing customers based on their transactional frequency.

**Monetary (M):**

Monetary value delves into the financial contribution of each customer. By evaluating the total sales, dividing them into sections, and assigning corresponding rates, we can identify Big Spenders, Loyal Customers, and Lost Cheap Customers based on their monetary engagement.

**Customer Segmentation:**

The culmination of the RFM analysis results in distinctive customer segments, each characterized by a unique combination of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values. These segments include Best Customers, Loyal Customers, Big Spender Customers, Almost Lost, Lost Customers, and Lost Cheap Customers.

## RFM Analysis in This Project:

**Reference Date (R):**

- Choose the reference date as maximum value of OrderDate column.
- Calculate the Recency (R) for each customer based on the **`reference date`** of each customer.
- Categorize customers based on Recency:
    - From min value to max value, divide the data into 3 equal sections then rated 1,2,3

**Frequency (F):**

- Determine Frequency (F) based on the **`lineNumber`** (number of units/items/products purchased in a transaction).
- Categorize customers based on Frequency:
    - From min value to max value, divide the data into 3 equal sections then rated 1,2,3


**Monetary (M):**

- Assess Monetary (M) based on the total sale (**`line_total`**).
    - Calculate Line_Total as **`Other Quantity * Sales amount`**.
    - Divide Line_Total into three equal sections and assign rates 1, 2, 3 accordingly.

**Customer Segmentation:**

After calculating R, F, and M, combine these values to create segments. Your segments based on RFM values are:

| Segment               | RFM                                      | Description |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------| --- |
| Best Customers        | (333)                                    | Recently bought a lot, buys often, and spends the most. |
| Loyal Customers       | (X3X)                                    | Buy most frequently. |
| Big Spenders          | (XX3)                                    | Spends the most, regardless of how often they buy. |
| Almost Lost Customers | (122, 123, 132, 133)                     | Haven’t purchased recently but purchased more frequently and spent a medium or large amount. |
| Lost Customers        | (111, 112, 121, 131, 113)                | Haven’t purchased recently but spent a small or medium amount. |
| New Customers  | (311, 211, 321, 312, 221, 212, 213, 211) | Purchased recently but there is no frequency record. |
|Potential Loyal Customers| (233, 222, 223, 322, 323, 332)|Close to Best Customers (contain 1 or 2 fields = 2 in RFM)|
| Others                |                                          |other cases |

### **Business Decision Support:**

Utilize these segments to make informed business decisions.

- Target marketing campaigns specifically for Best and Loyal customers.
- Implement retention strategies for Almost Lost and Lost customers.
- Adjust pricing or promotions for Big Spender customers.
- Monitor and analyze the impact of these strategies on customer behavior over time.
